# Notebooks for the course “Info 111: Introduction à l'informatique”

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/nthiery/Info111-notebooks/master)

This repository holds copies of the Jupyter notebooks used during the
practice sessions of a freshmen introductory programming course (in C++)
[Info 111](http://Nicolas.Thiery.name/Enseignement/Info111),
deliverered (in French!) at Université Paris Sud in the curicullum
"Mathématiques, Physique, Informatique".

This repository is meant for casual visitors that would like to
quickly browse through the notebooks, and possibly play with them
online using Binder (click on the badge above).

Note that this covers only the first weeks of the course. Later on,
the students switch to classical compilation-based C++ programming.

All the course material is under a CC license and available from the
[web page](http://Nicolas.Thiery.name/Enseignement/Info111).
The original notebooks -- containing solutions -- are maintained in a
separate private repository. Interested intructors are welcome to
contact the authors at Nicolas.Thiery at u-psud.fr.
